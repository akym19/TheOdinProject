    <h1>How to Fix a Relationship in 5 Steps</h1>

    <h2>1. Face and embrace your differences.</h2>
    <p>Ever know a couple who never seemed to argue, who was the envy of other couples in your circle of friends? They seemed to be the perfect pair. Next thing you know, you’re shocked to hear they’re <strong>splitting up.</strong></p>
    <p>We see this all the time. Couples who appear the most at peace may not be dealing with their differences. They may look good on the outside, but underneath it all they have a mountain of <em>hurt, anger, resentment, sadness, and fear</em> that they have been unable to share in their relationship.</p>
    <p>They may be “pleasers” who avoid conflict at all cost. Or maybe one person controls the relationship and the other submits. Either way, they are not facing and embracing their issues.</p>
    <p>The deepest emotional connections of love and intimacy are the ones where you and your partner genuinely express the most difficult feelings at the most difficult times; where you choose not to hide vulnerability; and where you willingly engage each other in the real feelings—<em>anger, fear, pain, and love.</em></p>

    <h2>2. Practice effective communication skills.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Carve out regular time for dialogue about concerns.</strong> State your thoughts in terms of behavior, without judgment, attack, or blame. Be specific, constructive, and positive.</li>
        <li><strong>Use “I” statements to convey your thoughts and feelings.</strong> Own your part of the problem. Tell your partner how his or her behavior affects you and why; e.g., “When you left for work without saying goodbye, I worried you might be angry with me.”</li>
        <li><strong>Hear your partner’s story fully.</strong> Everyone’s perception is valid, whether or not you agree with it. Listen without interrupting or judging. Be curious about your partner’s point of view; e.g., “Help me understand what you mean by …”</li>
        <li><strong>Paraphrase your partner’s thoughts.</strong> Affirming that you heard him or her does not mean you agree or disagree. It just means, “I understand and believe that’s the way you see it.”</li>
        <li><strong>Empathize with your partner’s feelings.</strong> Feelings are never right or wrong; they’re just feelings. And all of them are genuine. Expressing empathy validates that you heard your partner’s feelings without judgment; e.g., “I understand that’s how it makes you feel.”</li>
        <li><strong>Take your turn.</strong> Once your partner feels heard, share your story and ask your partner to validate and empathize with your thoughts and feelings. When people truly feel heard and validated, whether or not they agree, it’s like magic. They automatically feel better. Only then can people problem solve and come to consensus on solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Put the problem on the “chalkboard,” view it as a team, and resolve the problem.</strong> After each partner has had an opportunity to be heard, it is much easier to be rational and work toward solutions. Identify specific actions each person can take to fix his or her portion of the problem.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Love your partner the way he or she wants to receive love.</h2>
    <p>Make a list of responses to: “I feel loved when you …” Anything goes—give me flowers, plan a weekend away, bring home my favorite candy bar, initiate sex. Exchange lists. Giving love the way your partner enjoys receiving it is the greatest gift of all. Receiving love the way you enjoy it isn’t bad, either.</p>

    <h2>4. Create the habit of loving.</h2>
    <p>On holidays, we express our love with gifts and affection. On the other days, we often forget. Consciously doing small acts of love every day creates “love habits”—loving behaviors that become habitual. Practicing love habits grows connection and intimacy. It’s as simple as greeting each other after work every day with a kiss on the lips and a long hug, establishing a regular date night, going to bed together, and planning regular sex dates. When you show your love, you will feel your love.</p>

    <h2>5. Express gratitude for “the things your partner is supposed to do anyway.”</h2>
    <p>Most people thank their partner when he or she does something special. What if you thanked her for cooking a meal, or him for mowing the lawn? But wait. “Why should I thank my partner for the routine chores?” The answer: “Because it feels good.” Every drop of love you express nurtures and feeds the relationship.</p>
    <p>Practicing these five steps will grow your love and connection. Start today. Share this article with your partner and ensure that your relationship lasts a lifetime. It doesn’t happen by accident.</p>
